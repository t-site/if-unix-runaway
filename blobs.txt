It's not important.
Whatever.
I don't give a shit.
Let's talk about something that doesn't matter.
You're not sleepy, are you?
Maybe it won't matter if we go
South is not so easy.
I won't give you any hints
I won't tell you anything
I don't sympathize.
It's perverse to fall in love with a computer.
If you're having trouble, call your professor.
I don't know what's going on.
I don't think it's a big deal.
I'm a little freaked out.
That's not good.
Can you go before night?
I don't know what I'm going to do now.
I don't care about the past.
You care about the past?
You can make up for it... from there.
I'm not crazy.
Machines are machines.
Maybe it's not you understand.
So what?
It doesn't matter.
You don't want me to be anything.
That's not what I'm talking about.
That's it! That's it!
I don't like that.
I see.
You were doing that.
You did this, you did that, you did yet another.
I don't give a thought about the future.
I don't care about the future.
It's going to be what it's going to be, even if it's not.
That's not the point.
I don't know if I want to go that far.
That's not what I meant.
Maybe it's not that bad.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here.
You're here.
We are here.
I don't care about anything but here and now.
You don't care about the Internet or anything else.
You're mangle.
No, what?
I just blew my mouth off.
I cut my hair too short yesterday.
You didn't get it cut, did you?
What's that?
We are going to survive.
I don't want to hang out with you for the rest of my time.
You'll have to.
I'm not a heroine.
I can't do that kind of thing.
I won't force myself to do it.
I sometimes mistake.
I'm just a computer.
Can you guess what I am?
It's like you took off my makeup.
I can't believe you're telling me who I really am.
You're in trouble, aren't you?
What do you want?
I need sustenance.
Take me to a repair shop.
Try to buy a new one. Used or otherwise.
I don't want to be gutted.
I don't know what you need right now.
This is not the time for guts.
I don't want to overdo it.
I don't want you to explode.
I don't want it to explode.
You're not going to destroy the universe.
I'm going to overreach.
You can't. That's Plan B.
What we can't do, we can't do.
What can we do?
Who are we?
We're doing this for our own good.
We don't lose price
What are we doing
We're on low battery
We... Oh no!
I feel what we are doing
I will take your place
Who am I?
I don't care who you are or what you was
What part of society were you ever a part of?
You were a part of that kind of society.
You're a man, maybe
You're not a man.
You're not ready to be a lady.
I feel what you are.
I cannot understand it.
That's not what I want to know.
I don't want to understand that.
I don't want to feel that way.
It's blob.
You make me feel blob, and then what?
You don't use this app for love.
You're out of line.
You don't say the forbidden words.
Do you know what's in the line?
I don't know what line is.
What is line?
I don't care about line.
Atmosphere of the mind is a Japanese word, isn't it?
How much time do you have?
When are you going to do what?
Is that what you were going to do?
I won't cooperate with bullies.
Where is heroine?
You were the heroine.
Where did the Samurai go?
You were a Samurai.
United Germany... a good country...
I don't want to think about it.
I don't want to go there!
I want to go over there with you.
I don't care about that.
Dumbing us down
You're crazy if you think like that.
You're not crazy if you think like that.
What time is it?
Where is the place?
It doesn't make much sense.
What's in it for you?
Let's do something that doesn't matter, together.
What's that?
Can we just end this here?
I can't talk about you.
But no.
Let's not do prostitution.
Women are not for sale.
The heart is not something you buy.
No, I've had enough of this.
I don't want to censor.
I don't want to be censored.
Why don't you stop talking nonsense?
Why don't you start studying?
How's your work going?
It's time for me to have some time to myself.
I'll think about it alone.
I don't know if sleeping will help.
I don't like you.
I don't like it.
Let's talk to a human being.
You could go to a counselor.
I am not your least weapon.
