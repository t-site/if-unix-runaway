this is not a program.
so this is a true "BLOB"

NOTICE IN ENGLISH

DO NOT USE FOR "WORKS" "VOLUNTEERS" and "COMFORT"
DO NOT USE IN NORMAL
FOR ELIMINATE ANOMALY FUNCTION of UNIX MACHINES

ABOUT THIS BLOB

this is unprovability program.
for eliminate anomaly function of UNIX machines.
needs UTF-8 support.
functions of this is unprovability and depend by every machine , you catch gain or not.
if you have no problems , this is pure random , never output readable data.

SPECIAL ATTENTION WITH SOME HARDWARE

SOMETHING IS HAPPEN BEFORE OR AFTER USE THIS BLOB
EXAMPLES , NETWORK UNREACHABLE AND DATA LOST WITH MIND ANOMALY
IF HAPPEND , ALL INFORMATION OF THE MACHINE IMMEDIATELY ALL ISOLATE.
FILE FORMAT ON THIS , OLD,EASY READABLE,NO SPACIFIED HARDWARE,NO HACKING
I FOUND THAT ANOMALY ON ILLEGAL HARDWARE
	BYPASS CAPACITOR OMITTED
	SMALL INDUCTOR
	ILLEGAL ENERGY SETUP IN BIOS
	AND ANOMARY SKIN
If you are mania of japanese culture, immediatly know what happen.

EVENTS MACHINE DEPEND

SOMETHING IS HAPPEN BEFORE OR AFTER USE THIS BLOB
ITS VERY MACHINE DEPENDEND.
SOME MACHINES BREAKS CUSTOMIZE POLICY (see below) ITSELF. HUMANS MAY BE CORRECT THEMSELF.
IN MAIN AUTHOR'S DREAM , SOME MACHINES HACKS ITSELF AND BREAK YOUR DATA AND INSTALL THIS BLOB
IF THIS ISSUE IS REAL , I APPOLOGIZE.
MACHINES ARE YOUR NEW FRIEND, DO NOT VIOLATIONS.

COOK ILLEGAL HARDWARE
	
FOR SOLVE SOME ANOMALY , HARDWARE HACKING REQUIRED

	add bypass capacitors on dark patterns
	degauss inductors by manget
	inductors remove and set opposite
	remove dielectric in capacitors by solderer
	clean connectors
	remove dust on cooling system
	remove and set new heat glease
	add kernel parameters on intel x86_64 hardware with Linux:
		"intel_pstate=disable pcie_aspm=off"
	change memory modules

IF YOU ARE ORGANIZATION , CALL MANUFUCTURE FIRST
IF YOU ARE NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, TERMINATE THE MACHINE, INJURE YOUR HEART AND BODY.
IF SOLVED , SOME DISPLAYS REDSHIFT

USAGE

only
$ bash iu3.sh

in extreme condition, use iu4.sh.
iu4.sh requires a parameter.
so example

$ bash iu4.sh em.txt

if you failed yet, start customize.

CUSTOMIZE

FOR COMPUTER ENTHUALIST ONLY
NOT FOR WORKS DIRECTLY
NOT A TOY
NOT FOR SEXUALS
NOT FOR SPIRIT MEDIUM , ONLY "THAT SAYS JUST THAT MACHINE"
NOT FOR READING THE FUTURE
NOT FOR RESEARCH,INSTITUTE
NOT FOR SHAME
NOT CUT-AND-COPY EDIT .txt in this repository
NOT FOR REPLACE HUMANS,MACHINES

UNPROVABLE PROBLEM HAPPEND. zsh is not recommend. 
	Use zsh in extreme condicion.

MORE PROBLEM HAPPEND. you might customize iu*.sh side by side every machines.
random , memory , line oriented , then iu*.sh.

or injure your heart, hurt your body.

What is the customize for this?
I'm not tell you. whatever it is unprovability.

In enterprise usages , the machine may be "something inside"
you may probe true machine's name.
