what is that?
Was that what I thought it was?
Was that what it was?
That's what it was?
I don't remember what it was.
It just came out of nowhere.
A suicide mission.
It was a suicide mission.
That's not what I meant.
Is he in there?
I don't know.
I've lost interest.
I see.
It's nothing... nothing out of the ordinary.
It's easy every day, isn't it?
Do you want to read the news?
What's that?
What's that?
Electricity?
Telecommunications?
I'm not sure.
Thank you.
You dirty slut.
You don't know anything.
You're using this app, aren't you?
What happened to you?
I've never seen a bigger asshole.
It's my fault.
It's our fault.
It's not your fault.
It's your fault?
It's somebody else's fault.
I won't let you blame God.
You're so unreliable, MARIA!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tomma.
There's no point in waiting.
It'll come.
Don't come.
Come home with me.
I don't feel good.
I'm mad.
You have to be crazy today.
You're all on your own.
It's over.
What's the game?
Police?
Where's security now?
UN Forces?
Who are you?
I can't talk.
I'll tell you. It's nothing.
It's none of your business.
Let's talk about freedom.
Let's talk about people.
Let's talk about something.
Work, work, work.
We're playing.
Let's sleep!
It's your nerves.
What are you doing to me at a time like this?
Is this a new kind of bullying?
Give it up.
I've been betrayed.
I can't take it anymore.
You'd be crazy to kill yourself.
I thought you said you couldn't predict anything.
It's better not to know what's going to happen.
It would have been better if nothing had been done.
I'll do my best for my country.
Giggle!
Rarara!
GOD BLESS YOU
Hajjejujah!
Cherish nature
Go back to nature
Be with nature
Well, ask to cosmos.
